Players in the same position can often have different roles , which can be influenced by the playing style of their team . Comparing the abilities of players across different roles can be unfair since some roles may not require certain attributes that others do .
                        To address this issue , we not only divide players based on their roles but also consider their quality . This approach allows us to assess a player's performance in comparison to others at their level , accounting for the specific demands of their role and the attributes relevant to their position . By doing so, we can make a more accurate evaluation of a player's abilities and contributions within their respective position and role .
